# Writing Reactive Code

## What Is Reactive Programming?

Programming paradigm that works with asynchronous data streams

Data streams can be created from many things
- Ul Events
- Http Requests
- File Systems
- Array-like Objects
- Memory / Cache


A declarative programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change

Code is reactive when an input change leads to `an automatic change in output`

The reactive paradigm is centered around the idea of modeling `changes in state` as `a pipeline of transformations`.
1. Responding to user input and gestures.
2. Updating core state.
3. Executing transformation pipelines and push into streams.
4. Consume derived state from streams.
