## Angular Components
- All Angular apps are made of multiple different components
- Each component is designed to implement one 'thing' in the app that is visible on the screen
- A component wraps up all the HTML and code to make one little widget work correctly
- A component can be reused multiple times in the same application
- Components can be nested, or shown inside of each other
- Every app has a component called the 'App' component, and it is always the most parent component
- Each component has its own Component Class, Component Template, Component CSS File, and Spec File
