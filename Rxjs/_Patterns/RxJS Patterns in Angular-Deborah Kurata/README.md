How to think about RxJS and observable pipelines:

Tip 1:
What do you have?
What do you want?
When do you want it?

Tip 2:
Ensure each Observable is subscribed
Ensure each subscription is unsubscribed

Tip 3: Use the async pipe. Async pipe automatically subscribes and unsubscribed

Tip 4:
To respond to an action use a Subject or BehaviorSubject

Tip 5: Leverage IDE


Tip 6: To subscribe to an inner Observable and flatten the result, use a higher-order mapping operator


Tip 7: To work with multiple streams, use a combination operator
