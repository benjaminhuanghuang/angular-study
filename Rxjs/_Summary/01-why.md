## Why (advantage)
- Work with different data source using the same techniques and operators.

- Combine several data sources 

- Watch and react to user interactions or data changes

- Lazy: evaluation does not start until subscription when we need the result
  
- Rxjs has built-in error handling

- We can cancel asynchronous actions



## Can do
- React to user actions
  
- React to state changes

- Combine data stream
  
- communicate between components

- Be resilient to failures

- Manage state
