# What Is Reactive Programming?

Programming paradigm that works with asynchronous data streams

Data streams can be created from many things

- Ul Events
- Http Requests
- File Systems
- Array-like Objects
- Memory / Cache

A declarative programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change

Code is reactive when an input change leads to `an automatic change in output`
