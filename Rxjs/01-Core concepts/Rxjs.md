# What is RxJS

## ReactiveX (Reactive Extension)
An API specification for asynchronous programming with observable streams.

Using Observable and Stream to handle asynchronous programming.

ReactiveX is a combination of the best ideas from the `Observer pattern`, the `Iterator pattern`, and `functional programming`

ReactiveX combines the `Observer Pattern` with the `Iterator Pattern` and `functional programming` with collections to fill the need for an ideal way of `managing sequences of events`.

## RxJS
RxJS is a library for `observing` and `reacting` to data and events by using observable sequences

RxJS is designed to work with `asynchronous` actions and events

Think of RxJs as Lodash for events.
