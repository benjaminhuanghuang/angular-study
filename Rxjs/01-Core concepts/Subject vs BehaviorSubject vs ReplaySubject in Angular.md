## Subject
Subjects are observables and observers at the same time. 

Subject is like EventEmitter. When an event is emitted, the subject notifies all the listeners.

We can subscribe to them and we can emit values to them. 
We can also use them as event emitters.


### Use subjects for cross component communication. 
```ts
import{ Injectable } from
import { Subject } from "rxjs";

@Injectable()
export class DataService{
  dataEmitter = new Subject<string>();
  
  raiseDataEmitterEvent (data: string){
    this. dataEmitter.next(data);
  }
}
```

## BehaviorSubject
BehaviorSubject is a special type of subject that requires an initial value and always `retains the last value` to `emit it to new subscribers`. 

When you subscribe, it will give you the latest value that was emitted before you tuned in, and then you continue getting updates. 

In other words, if you have any subscribers coming late to the game, they will get the last value emitted by the stream. 
This will always give you a value when you subscribe.

```ts
import { BehaviorSubject } from 'rxjs' ;

const bs$ = new BehaviorSubject( 1 );

// BehaviorSubject we donâ€™t need to call the next() method. 
// When a new subscriber subscribes to it, it will immediately receive the last emitted value from the subject. 
bs$.subscribe((value) => {
  console.log(value);
});

bs$.next( 2 );

// 1
// 2
```
BehaviorSubject is hot i.e: code gets executed and emits value even if there is no observer.


## ReplaySubject
can help by keeping a buffer of previous values that will be emitted to new subscriptions.
```ts
import { ReplaySubject } from 'rxjs';

/* create an instance of ReplaySubject. */
const replaySubject = new ReplaySubject<number>();

/* Subscribe to subject. */
replaySubject.subscribe({
  next: (value) => console.log('before:', value),
  error: (error) => console.error('before', error),
  complete: () => console.log('complete before')
});

/* Emit some values. */
replaySubject.next(1);
replaySubject.next(2);
replaySubject.next(3);

/* Subscribe late to subject. */
replaySubject.subscribe({
  next: (value) => console.log('after:', value),
  error: (error) => console.error('after:', error),
  complete: () => console.log('complete after')
});

/* Complete the observable stream. */
replaySubject.complete();

before: 1
before: 2
before: 3
after: 1
after: 2
after: 3
complete before
complete after

```
