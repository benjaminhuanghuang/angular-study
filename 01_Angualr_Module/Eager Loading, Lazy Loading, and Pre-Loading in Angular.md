# Eager Loading, Lazy Loading, and Pre-Loading in Angular
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0DN8oz7LCE

Eager Loading: modules under Eager Loading
would be loaded `before` the application starts. This is
the default module-loading strategy.


Lazy Loading: modules under Lazy Loading
would be loaded `on demand after` the application
starts. It helps to start application faster.

Pre-Loading: Modules under Pre-Loading would
be loaded automatically `after` the application starts.
