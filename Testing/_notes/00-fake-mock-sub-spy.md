A test fake is an object you use in a test to substitute for the real
thing.

A mock is a fake that simulates the real object and keeps track of when it’s called and what arguments it receives.

A stub is a simple fake with no logic, and it always returns the same value.

A test uses a spy to measure if a method was called, how many times it was called, and with
what arguments.
