# Angular Interceptor

Interceptors are powerful tools for managing HTTP traffic within Angular applications. By intercepting requests and responses, developers can implement a wide range of functionalities, from authentication and caching to logging and error handling. Understanding and effectively utilizing interceptors can significantly enhance the reliability, maintainability, security, and performance of Angular applications.

Create an Angular Interceptor

```bash
ng generate interceptor functional

ng generate interceptor dibased
```

## Types of Interceptors

1. Functional Interceptors:
These are functions that accept the outgoing request and a next function representing the next step in the interceptor chain. They are preferred for their predictable behavior.

2. DI-based Interceptors:
These are injectable classes that implement the HttpInterceptor interface. They offer similar capabilities to functional interceptors but are configured differently through Angularâ€™s Dependency Injection system.
