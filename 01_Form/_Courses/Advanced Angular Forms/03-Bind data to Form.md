## ngModel
The ngModel directive is used to bind the value of a form element to a property of a component.
It is used in template-driven forms to create a two-way data binding between the form element and the component.
```html

  <input [(ngModel)]="userInfo.firstName" name="first-name" type="text" id="name" placeholder="">
```
