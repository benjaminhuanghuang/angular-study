# Template Driven Forms

Template-driven forms are the basic forms that are suitable for the development of a limited number of fields and with simpler validation.
In this form, each field is represented as a property in the component class.

Key concepts in Template Driven Forms:

- ngForm Directive: This directive represents an angular form and exposes methods and properties related to it for validation and data manipulation purposes.

- ngModel Directive: This directive is used to achieve two-way data bindings between different form control elements.

- Validation Properties: Angular provides different validator properties that can be applied to form controls to indicate their validation state.

- Validation Directive: Angular provides several built-in validation directives that can be used with ngModel to perform validation.
