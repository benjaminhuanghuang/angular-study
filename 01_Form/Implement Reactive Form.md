## Step 1: Import the required Angular modules
In your component’s module file (e.g., app.module.ts), import the ReactiveFormsModule from @angular/forms. 
This module provides the necessary classes and directives for reactive forms.

## Step 2: Create the form controls and form group
In your component file (e.g., position.component.ts), import the necessary classes from @angular/forms, such as FormBuilder, FormGroup, and Validators. 
Use the FormBuilder to create the form controls and group them together in a form group.

## Step 3: Bind the form controls in the template
In your component’s template (e.g., position.component.html), use the formGroup directive to bind the form group to the HTML form element. 
For each form control, use the formControlName directive to bind it to the corresponding control in the form group.

## Step 4: Handle form submission and validation
In your component’s class, you can handle the form submission by implementing a method (e.g., submitForm()). 
In this method, you can check the validity of the form using the valid property of the form group. You can also access the form values using the value property.
