# Template Driven Forms Vs. Reactive Forms:

Template-driven forms and reactive forms are two ways to create forms in Angular, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

In general, if you have a simple form with basic validation requirements, template-driven forms might be a good choice. However, for more complex forms with dynamic fields or advanced validation needs, reactive forms are usually the preferred approach.

## Template driven forms

Define a template driven form everything we do in the view template

Easier to use and understand, especially for simple forms.
Form logic is mostly in the template, making it `less maintainable` for complex forms.
Two-way data binding is used [(ngModel)] for form controls.
`Less control` over form validation and error handling compared to reactive forms.

## Reactive forms

Define the form and the form control rules by writing some code

More flexible and maintainable, especially for complex forms.
Form logic is in the component class, making it easier to test and manage.
Reactive forms provide better support for dynamic forms and custom validation.

`More boilerplate code` compared to template-driven forms.
